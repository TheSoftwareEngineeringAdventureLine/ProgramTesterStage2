The testing function can traverse a directory looking for source code. Compile that code, then
look for test cases and run the compiled code with the given test case outputting the result in a 
new document. It can then compare that document with the expected results document and write
to the log file if it passed or failed. Then it will continue looking for test cases until all the test cases
in the root folder have been found. The tester will then write the total number of test cases passed,
total failed and the percentage passed and failed.
