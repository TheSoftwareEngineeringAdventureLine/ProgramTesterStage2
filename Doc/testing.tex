\chapter{System  and Unit Testing}

The major testing used was running the program and trying to modify it to work how
we wanted it to.   The test cases provided by Dr. Logar provided a frame to base our
test cases on.

\section{Overview}
The first thing we did was get the code working.   Then we took the package provided to us
by Dr. Logar to see if the program was getting output that made sense. 



\section{Dependencies}
No testing framworks were used on this sprint.


\section{Test Setup and Execution}
The test cases were provided to us by Dr. Logar on the course website.
